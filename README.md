## Flashy - A Fun Flashcard Learning Game
# Overview
Flashy is a flashcard-based learning game built using Python. The game helps users learn new words or phrases in different languages through a simple and interactive interface. Users can flip through flashcards, marking the words they know or need to revisit, making it an excellent tool for language learning or memorization.

# Features

✅ Simple interface with "Know" and "Don't Know" buttons.
🔄 Flashcards update dynamically based on user input.
💾 Data persistence to save progress and revisit unknown words.
🎨 A clean, user-friendly GUI.


# Technologies Used
1.Python 3.7+
2.Tkinter: For GUI development.
3.Pandas: To manage the dataset (e.g., words or phrases).
4.Random: For shuffling the flashcards.

# How It Works
- **The app loads a dataset of words or phrases in multiple languages (CSV format).**
- **A flashcard is displayed with a word/phrase in a language (e.g., French).**
- **Users can mark the card as:**
✅ "Know it" - The word will not appear again.
❌ "Don't Know it" - The word remains in the deck.
The game dynamically updates the flashcards based on user input.
Progress is saved to ensure users can continue learning from where they left off.
